    <section class="ranking-text" style="margin: 2rem;">
    <h1 style="margin: 2rem 0;">Factors influencing the ranking:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Play Money Balance:</b> Accumulating more play money might contribute
        positively to a player's rank. It could signify experience and success
        within the play money games.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Game Performance:</b> Winning games or tournaments, placing high in
        leaderboards, or consistently performing well can positively impact a
        player's rank.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Activity and Engagement:</b> Regularly participating in games, staying
        active on the platform, and contributing positively to the community
        might also factor into the ranking algorithm.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Skill Level:</b> Some systems might assess a player's skill level based on
        gameplay, strategies employed, or even through special skill-based
        challenges. This could influence the ranking as well.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1 style="margin: 2rem 0;">How the ranking tiers are structured:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Basic Tiers: </b>Newcomers or less active players might be in the lower
        tiers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Intermediate Tiers:</b> Players with moderate play money balances and
        reasonable game performance might fall into these tiers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Advanced Tiers:</b> These tiers could include players with substantial play
        money balances, consistent wins, high leaderboard rankings, or notable
        skill levels.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Elite Tiers:</b> Reserved for the top players with significant play money,
        exceptional skills, and outstanding achievements on the platform.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1 style="margin: 2rem 0;">Advantages of higher ranks:</h1>
    <p>
      Players in higher ranks might enjoy various perks, such as: Access to
      exclusive tournaments or games. Special badges or avatars to showcase
      their rank. Priority support or customer service. Recognition within the
      community.
    </p>
    <h1 style="margin: 2rem 0;">Transparency and Fairness:</h1>
    <p>
      The ranking system should ideally be transparent, with clear criteria for
      advancement. It should also strive to be fair, rewarding skill and
      activity rather than just play money accumulation. In essence, while play
      money balance could be a contributing factor, a comprehensive ranking
      system in a poker website based on play money should consider various
      aspects of a player's performance and engagement to determine their rank.
